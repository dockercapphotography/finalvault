-- 037_microsite_logo_in_rpc.sql
-- Fixes a real gap: logo_r2_key was added to `microsites` in migration
-- 036, but get_site_by_hostname() (sql/035) was never updated to return
-- it -- so the public renderer had no way to know a logo existed at all.
--
-- Also resolves the fallback here (microsite override, else the
-- photographer's own account logo) server-side, so the frontend never
-- has to guess -- same principle as studio_name's COALESCE in the
-- placeholder branch.
--
-- Run after: 036_microsite_logo_override.sql
